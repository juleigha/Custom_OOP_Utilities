# Rare, Non Proprietary code
Every now and then we get to write code at work that is completely abstract :) 

## AutoTestDjangoSerializers.py
This found many bugs in the data returned from my team's API's

## FormBuilder.cs
All our forms needed basic data validation. Repeated code was piling up. I couldnt find a nice, lightweight libraray so I made one.
